## üöÄ Getting Started

Follow these instructions to set up and run the project locally.

### Prerequisites

-   [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) (v18 or later)
-   [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) (or yarn/pnpm)
-   A [Firebase](https://firebase.google.com/) project.

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone <repository-url>
cd <repository-directory>
```

### 2. Install Dependencies

Install all the necessary packages for the project.

```bash
npm install
```

### 3. Firebase Setup

This project requires a Firebase backend to function.

1.  **Create a Firebase Project**: Go to the [Firebase Console](https://console.firebase.google.com/) and create a new project.
2.  **Create a Web App**: Inside your project, add a new Web App and copy the `firebaseConfig` credentials.
3.  **Enable Services**:
    -   **Authentication**: Enable `Google` and `Email/Password` sign-in providers. Add `localhost` to the list of authorized domains.
    -   **Firestore**: Create a new Firestore database. Start in **test mode** for development.
    -   **Storage**: Create a new Cloud Storage bucket. Start with the default test rules.
4.  **Create Initial Data**: In Firestore, create collections for `subjects`, `semesters`, `courses`, and `batches` and add a few sample documents to each so the dropdown menus work.
5.  **Create Admin User**: In Firebase Authentication, create an admin user with the email `admin@mycecnotes.com` and password `admin123`. Copy the generated UID and create a corresponding document in a `users` collection in Firestore with an `isAdmin` field set to `true`.

### 4. Set Up Environment Variables

Create a `.env.local` file in the root of the project and add your Firebase credentials.

```env
# Firebase Configuration
NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_API_KEY=YOUR_API_KEY
NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_AUTH_DOMAIN=YOUR_AUTH_DOMAIN
NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID=YOUR_PROJECT_ID
NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_STORAGE_BUCKET=YOUR_STORAGE_BUCKET
NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_MESSAGING_SENDER_ID=YOUR_MESSAGING_SENDER_ID
NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_APP_ID=YOUR_APP_ID
```

### 5. Run the Project

Start the local development server.

```bash
npm run dev
```

The application will be available at `http://localhost:9002`.
