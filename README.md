## üöÄ Getting Started

Follow these instructions to set up and run the project locally.

### Prerequisites

-   [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) (v18 or later)
-   [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) (or yarn/pnpm)
-   A [Firebase](https://firebase.google.com/) project.

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone <repository-url>
cd <repository-directory>
```

### 2. Install Dependencies

Install all the necessary packages for the project.

```bash
npm install
```

### 3. Firebase Setup

This project requires a Firebase backend to function.

1.  **Create a Firebase Project**: Go to the [Firebase Console](https://console.firebase.google.com/) and create a new project.
2.  **Create a Web App**: Inside your project, add a new Web App. When prompted, copy the `firebaseConfig` object.
3.  **Enable Services**:
    -   **Authentication**:
        -   Go to **Build > Authentication** and click "Get started".
        -   In the "Sign-in method" tab, enable both `Google` and `Email/Password` providers.
        -   Under "Settings", add `localhost` to the list of authorized domains for testing.
    -   **Firestore**:
        -   Go to **Build > Firestore Database** and click "Create database".
        -   Start in **test mode** for development. This allows open read/write access.
    -   **Storage**:
        -   Go to **Build > Storage** and click "Get started".
        -   Start with the default test rules.
4.  **Create Initial Data (Required for Filters)**:
    - In Firestore, you need to manually create collections for the filter dropdowns to work.
    - Create the following collections: `subjects`, `semesters`, `courses`, and `batches`.
    - Inside each collection, add a few sample documents. For example, in `subjects`, add a document with a field `name` set to "Data Structures". In `semesters`, add a document with a field `value` set to `1` (as a number).
5.  **Create Admin User & Permissions**:
    - Go back to **Authentication** and click **Add user**.
    - Create a user with an email (e.g., `admin@mycecnotes.com`) and a password.
    - **Copy the User UID** for this new user.
    - Go to the **Firestore Database** and select the `users` collection.
    - Click **Add document**. In the **Document ID** field, **paste the User UID** you copied.
    - Add a field named `isAdmin` of type `boolean` and set it to `true`.
    - You can also add other fields like `name` and `email` to complete the profile.

### 4. Set Up Environment Variables

Create a `.env.local` file in the root of the project. Paste your Firebase web app configuration into it.

```env
# Firebase Configuration
NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_API_KEY=YOUR_API_KEY
NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_AUTH_DOMAIN=YOUR_AUTH_DOMAIN
NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID=YOUR_PROJECT_ID
NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_STORAGE_BUCKET=YOUR_STORAGE_BUCKET
NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_MESSAGING_SENDER_ID=YOUR_MESSAGING_SENDER_ID
NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_APP_ID=YOUR_APP_ID
```

### 5. Run the Project

Start the local development server.

```bash
npm run dev
```

The application will be available at `http://localhost:9002`.
